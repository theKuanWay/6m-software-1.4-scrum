## Assignment

### Brief

Write your answers for each scenario:

Scenario 1:
Imagine you are hired by a startup company for a school to implement their IT infrastructure as their IT consultant. n your own words (300 words or less), describe how could implementing Scrum help their IT team improve their productivity.

```
Implementing Scrum in a startup company focused on building IT infrastructure for a school can significantly enhance the team's productivity by fostering a structured yet flexible approach to project management. Scrum is an agile framework that encourages collaboration, transparency, and iterative progress, all of which are crucial for a rapidly growing organization.

First, Scrum breaks down the complex task of setting up IT infrastructure into manageable, bite-sized pieces called sprints. These sprints typically last 1-4 weeks and focus on delivering a specific part of the project, allowing the team to make continuous progress and quickly address any challenges that arise. This iterative process ensures that the team can adapt to changes, such as new requirements from the school or unexpected technical issues, without losing momentum.

Second, Scrum promotes regular communication through daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives. These meetings keep everyone aligned on the project's goals, progress, and any obstacles. By addressing issues in real-time, the team can avoid bottlenecks and keep the project on track.

Furthermore, Scrum empowers the IT team by involving them in the planning and decision-making processes. Each team member has a voice in determining what can realistically be achieved in each sprint, fostering a sense of ownership and accountability. This collaborative environment not only boosts morale but also leads to higher-quality outcomes, as the team is motivated to deliver their best work.

Finally, the transparency and regular feedback loops inherent in Scrum allow for continuous improvement. After each sprint, the team can reflect on what went well and what could be improved, leading to incremental enhancements in both the product and the process.

In summary, implementing Scrum can help the startup's IT team deliver a robust, adaptable IT infrastructure for the school more efficiently, with higher quality and greater team satisfaction.

Scenario 2:
Write ten (10) user stories for a book-borrowing website for a library. Write it in the format: `As a ____, I want to ____, so that _____`.

```
1. As a library member, I want to search for books by title, author, or genre, so that I can easily find the books I want to borrow.
2. As a library member, I want to view the availability status of a book, so that I know if it is currently available for borrowing.
3. As a library member, I want to reserve a book that is currently checked out, so that I can borrow it when it becomes available.
4. As a library member, I want to see my borrowing history, so that I can keep track of the books Iâ€™ve read and returned.
5. As a library member, I want to receive notifications when my borrowed books are due for return, so that I can avoid late fees.
6. As a library member, I want to renew my borrowed books online, so that I can extend my borrowing period without visiting the library.
7. As a library member, I want to browse recommended books based on my borrowing history, so that I can discover new books that match my interests.
8. As a librarian, I want to manage the inventory of books, so that I can keep the catalog up-to-date with available and borrowed items.
9. As a librarian, I want to track the borrowing patterns of members, so that I can identify popular books and make informed purchasing decisions.
10. As a library member, I want to suggest new books for the library to acquire, so that I can request books that are not currently in the collection.
